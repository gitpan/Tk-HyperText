<h1>Demonstration of Capabilities</h1>

This page demonstrates all of the capabilities of Tk::HyperText's rendering
power.

<h1>Font Tags</h1>

Basic, unformatted font.<p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Comic Sans font, with a little
 <font face="Impact">Impact</font> thrown in the middle.</font><p>

Some <font color="red">"red" font, with some <font color="#0000FF">"#0000FF"
 font</font> in the middle.</font><p>

<font size="1">Small font.</font> <font size="4">Big font.</font>
 <font size="6">Very big font.</font><p>

<font back="#FFFF00">This text was important enough to highlight.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#0000FF" back="#FFFFFF">This particular
 string of text has all the possible font attributes defined.</font>

<h1>Hyperlinks</h1>

This link to <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> should
 open in your own web browser if you click it, as would this other link to
 <a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">the Fedora Project</a>.<p>

On the other hand, this link <a href="index.html">back to the homepage</a> should
 load within this window, as would this link to <a href="about.html">the About page</a>.<p>

Finally, <a href="nothing.html">this link should get you a "404 Error"</a> if you
 click on it. :)

<h1>Markup Tags</h1>

We have <b>bold</b> text, and some <b>strong</b> text. Also, some <i>italic</i>
 text, and some <em>emphasized</em> ones too.<p>

We also have text that is <u>underlined</u> or <ins>inserted</ins>, as well as
 some that has been <s>overstriked</s> or <del>deleted</del>.<p>

<b>The tags can <em>stack on top of <u>eachother</u> rather <del>easily</del></em>,
 as well.</b><p>

There is also <sup>superscript</sup> and <sub>subscript</sub>, and <code>coded
 text</code>, and <tt>typewrited</tt> text.<p>

And finally, preformatted text, like this:<p>

<pre> #####\             _             /#####
 #( )# |          _( )__         | #( )#
 ##### |         /_    /         | #####
 #" "# |     ___m/I_ //_____     | #" "#
 # O # |____#-x.\ /++m\ /.x-#____| # O #
 #m.m# |   /" \ ///###\\\ / "\   | #m.m#
 #####/    ######/     \######    \#####</pre>

<h1>Blockquotes</h1>

Blockquotes create indented sections of text. They can even "stack" within eachother.
 Take for example this poem:

<blockquote>
<font size="5">I</font>n Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br>
A stately pleasure-dome decree :<br>
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
Through caverns measureless to man
    <blockquote>Down to a sunless sea.</blockquote>
So twice five miles of fertile ground<br>
With walls and towers were girdled round :<br>
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br>
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree ;<br>
And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br>
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

    <blockquote>But oh ! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br>
    Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover !<br>
    A savage place ! as holy and enchanted<br>
    As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br>
    By woman wailing for her demon-lover !<br>
    And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<br>
    As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,<br>
    A mighty fountain momently was forced :<br>
    Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst<br>
    Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,<br>
    Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail :<br>
    And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever<br>
    It flung up momently the sacred river.<br>
    Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<br>
    Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<br>
    Then reached the caverns measureless to man,<br>
    And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean :<br>
    And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far<br>
    Ancestral voices prophesying war !<br>
    The shadow of the dome of pleasure<br>
    Floated midway on the waves ;<br>
    Where was heard the mingled measure<br>
    From the fountain and the caves.</blockquote>
It was a miracle of rare device,<br>
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice !
    <blockquote>A damsel with a dulcimer<br>
    In a vision once I saw :<br>
    It was an Abyssinian maid,<br>
    And on her dulcimer she played,<br>
    Singing of Mount Abora.<br>
    Could I revive within me<br>
    Her symphony and song,<br>
    To such a deep delight 'twould win me,</blockquote>
That with music loud and long,<br>
I would build that dome in air,<br>
That sunny dome ! those caves of ice !<br>
And all who heard should see them there,<br>
And all should cry, Beware ! Beware !<br>
His flashing eyes, his floating hair !<br>
Weave a circle round him thrice,<br>
And close your eyes with holy dread,<br>
For he on honey-dew hath fed,<br>
And drunk the milk of Paradise.
</blockquote>
