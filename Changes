Revision history for Perl extension Tk::HyperText.

0.04 June 23, 2007

  - Added support for the <basefont> tag.
  - Added support for <ul>, <ol>, and <li>. I've even extended the HTML specs a
    little and added "diamonds" as a shape for <ul>, and allowed <ul> to specify
    a decimal escape code (<ul type="#0164">)
  - Added a "page history", so that the "visited link color" on pages can actually
    be applied to the links.
  - Fixed the <blockquote> so that the margin applies to the right side as well.

  - Bugfix: on consecutive insert() commands (without clearing it in between),
    the entire content of the HTML already in the widget would be inserted again,
    in addition to the new content. This has been fixed.

0.01 June 20, 2007

  - Initial release.
